## Description

My assignment takes place on the high seas as I attempt to simulate an epic sea chase. The scene shows a pirate ship, weaving its way in and around islands and castles in its attempt to escape the pursuing enemy naval fleet.

## How it Works

The pirate ship follows a path throughout the scene whilst the pursuing fleet follows the pirate ship whilst trying to avoid crashing and sinking. There are many cameras set up throughout the scene which are changed and accessed via a camera manager script I created.# Game-Engines-2-Assignment
Repo for my naval battle using game AI behaviours and techniques.

## What I am most proud of

I'm really satisfied with the array of camera angles and positions I used. I think it adds to the aesthetic of my scene and helps create the sense of adventure I was going for. I am also proud of the realness of my pirate ship's behaviour. I feel as if I got a realistic floating behaviour functional as well as realistic ship movement as a whole. Despite there being no water active in the scene, this was purely due to performance related issues. However, I wrote some scripts such as the OceanScroll script to further try and optimise the water. Despite the water still being too unstable to use, these scripts proved to be quite efficient and will definitely be reusable in further projects.

#### Scenes A and B.

These two scenes are to set the tone of the pursuit. You will be introduced to the main pirate ship that is making an attempt to escape an incoming fleet.
The camera will then cut to a different angle, giving the viewer a clear indication to how close the fleet in pursuit is.

#### Scenes C and D.

After the tone of the pursuit has been set and the observer has grasped what is going and who is who. The pursuing ships will begin to fire cannonballs at the feeling pirate ship. Here the camera will pan to multiple different angles to give the viewer a more extensive understanding of the chase.
There will be an aerial shot of the scene which will encapsulate the size of the pursuing fleet and the grandeur of the event.

#### Scenes E and F.

The camera will introduce a first person view of the pirate ship in an attempt to capture the scene from a passengers point of view. The intesiveness off the cannon fire will be highlighted here as to cause some apprehension in the viewer. 
Then some obstacles in the form of sea stacks/rocks/ship wrecks/islands will appear ahead of the fleeing ship in which the ship must avoid. The ship must pass through these obstacles to escape.

#### Scenes G and H.

In scene G, the pursuing fleet will start to fall one by one as they cannot maneuver around the obstacels as well as the pirate ship. Here they will crash and destroy or sink. 
Following this scene, thecamera will pan out, similar to the opening scene which will in turn capture the final moments before the pirate ship escapes.
