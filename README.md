#### Scenes A and B.

These two scenes are to set the tone of the pursuit. You will be introduced to the main pirate ship that is making an attempt to escape an incoming fleet.
The camera will then cut to a different angle, giving the viewer a clear indication to how close the fleet in pursuit is.

#### Scenes C and D.

After the tone of the pursuit has been set and the observer has grasped what is going and who is who. The pursuing ships will begin to fire cannonballs at the feeling pirate ship. Here the camera will pan to multiple different angles to give the viewer a more extensive understanding of the chase.
There will be an aerial shot of the scene which will encapsulate the size of the pursuing fleet and the grandeur of the event.

#### Scenes E and F.

The camera will introduce a first person view of the pirate ship in an attempt to capture the scene from a passengers point of view. The intesiveness off the cannon fire will be highlighted here as to cause some apprehension in the viewer. 
Then some obstacles in the form of sea stacks/rocks/ship wrecks/islands will appear ahead of the fleeing ship in which the ship must avoid. The ship must pass through these obstacles to escape.

#### Scenes G and H.

In scene G, the pursuing fleet will start to fall one by one as they cannot maneuver around the obstacels as well as the pirate ship. Here they will crash and destroy or sink. 
Following this scene, thecamera will pan out, similar to the opening scene which will in turn capture the final moments before the pirate ship escapes.
